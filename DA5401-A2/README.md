### Project Overview: Mushroom Classification using PCA and Logistic Regression

This notebook applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction on the Mushroom Dataset, a high-dimensional categorical dataset classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous. The goal is to evaluate how PCA affects the performance of a Logistic Regression classifier by comparing results on original versus PCA-transformed data.

**Kaggle Dataset:** [Mushroom Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification)
