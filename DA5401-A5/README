In this assignment, I will be exploring the Yeast Dataset to understand the challenges of multi-label classification by applying advanced non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically t-SNE and Isomap. The dataset consists of gene expression data, and the task is to predict the functional categories of genes across 14 possible labels. Using t-SNE and Isomap, I will reduce the feature dimensions and create 2D visualizations to identify data veracity issues such as noisy labels, outliers, and hard-to-learn samples. These visualizations will help me understand the challenges a classifier would face when working with this dataset and how these data issues impact the overall performance.

The final deliverable will be a Jupyter Notebook that includes my code, visualizations, and an analysis of the results. I will justify my choices, such as selecting the appropriate perplexity for t-SNE, and explain how I approached the data preprocessing and scaling. Additionally, I will compare the visualizations produced by t-SNE and Isomap, discussing their ability to reveal the underlying structure of the data. The notebook will also include insights on how data veracity issues affect machine learning models and the difficulties of classifying gene expression data based on the observed patterns.
