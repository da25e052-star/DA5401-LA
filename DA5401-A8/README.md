This assignment demonstrates the application of ensemble machine learning methods to a time-series regression problem. We aim to predict the demand for shared bikes by training and evaluating Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking models. The dataset contains detailed hourly records of bike rentals, including environmental and temporal features like weather, season, and time of day. Through this analysis, we will see how combining multiple models can lead to more robust and accurate predictions than any single model alone.

The notebook is structured to guide you through the process, from data exploration and preprocessing to model implementation and evaluation. We will focus on minimizing the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to gauge the effectiveness of each ensemble strategy. The findings will be supported by clear visualizations and a narrative that explains the results, making the analysis reproducible and easy to understand.
