This assignment involves working with the UCI Credit Card Default Clients dataset to handle missing values and analyze the impact of different imputation strategies on the performance of a classification model. The dataset contains information on credit card clients, including features like age, bill amounts, and payment history, with some values missing. The objective is to simulate a real-world scenario where data is missing at random (MAR), and apply three imputation methods—simple imputation (baseline), linear regression imputation, and non-linear regression imputation—to handle these missing values. The effectiveness of each imputation method will be assessed by evaluating a classification model's performance on the imputed datasets.

In this project, you will start by loading and preparing the dataset, artificially introducing missing values to simulate a substantial missing data problem. Then, you will apply the three imputation techniques to clean the data, train a classification model (Logistic Regression), and assess its performance using standard evaluation metrics. Finally, you will compare the performance of the different imputation strategies, discussing their trade-offs and making a recommendation on the best approach for handling missing data in credit risk assessment. The analysis will be presented in a well-commented Jupyter notebook, providing insights into the relationship between imputation methods and classification performance.
