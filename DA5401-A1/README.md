Movies are more than just entertainment—they are high-stakes projects where creative vision, financial investment, and audience reception collide. Understanding what drives a movie’s success is a central question for filmmakers, producers, and analysts alike. In this assignment, we take on the role of data detectives, using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset to uncover the hidden dynamics behind box office performance and audience ratings.

The dataset provides rich information on budgets, revenues, genres, directors, casts, and ratings, but it is not analysis-ready. It requires thoughtful cleaning and transformation before insights can be drawn. Once prepared, we will apply advanced visualization techniques to test our hypothesis and reveal patterns that explain why some films succeed while others fail.

Our objective is not only to generate plots, but to weave them into a cohesive narrative—a data story that explores how production budgets, genres, and directors influence movie outcomes. Through this process, we aim to move beyond descriptive statistics and build an evidence-based understanding of what makes a movie thrive in the competitive film industry
